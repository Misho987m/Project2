								<h1 style="color:#ffffff;">You may recognize one of the dogs in this picture: 
								we’re pretty sure it’s Andy Rubin’s dog, Alex Cosmo [we’ve just been notified that 
								the dog’s name is in fact Cosmo, and Cosmo not only “contributes to most big decisions 
								at Playground” but also serves as its head of security]. Andy Rubin is the co-founder of Android, 
								and for about a year, he managed the robotics program at Google (now known as Alphabet). More recently,
								he’s been running a hardware incubator called Playground, which has enough clout to summon up another 
								robotic dog with Google ties: Boston Dynamics’ Spot. </h1>

								<h1 style="color:#ffffff;">Transport Minister Simon Bridges said Domino’s had made contact
								"a few weeks ago" to inform the Government about DRU and see if New Zealand was interested 
								in hosting trials. Bridges said there were "no particular legal blockages" to trialling 
								driverless technology on the country’s roads, but the authorities needed to ensure any 
								trials met safety requirements and other regulations. Backing projects like Domino’s were about
								"cementing our country’s place as an early adopter and tech-savvy place", he said.  </h1>

							<div>
								<h1 style="color:#ffffff;">Scientists at Duke University have demonstrated a wireless brain-machine 
								interface (BMI) that allows monkeys to navigate a robotic wheelchair using their thoughts. This is 
								the first long-term wireless BMI implant that has given high-quality signals to precisely control a 
								wheelchair’s movements in real time. </h1>

								<h1 style="color:#ffffff;">The SuperDroid HD2-S Mastiff Tactical / Surveillance Robot w/ 
								5DOF Arm is a large sized, rugged robot that can be quickly deployed in an emergency. 
								Weighing ~120 lbs, this treaded robot is equipped with an arm making it ideal for hostage 
								and hazardous surveillance and inspection, door opening, remote surveillance and EOD disposal. </h1>

								<h1 style="color:#ffffff;">XDog is a small electric quadruped designed and built by Xing Wang,
								a graduate student at Shanghai University, with support from his adviser Jia Wenchuan. The robot
								has 12 motors (each leg has 3 DoF), and uses force sensors on each foot, IMU, and joint-angle sensors 
								for control. Wang says XDog “has just been born,” and he’s still working on its walking gait 
								(top speed is currently about 0.6 m/s) and hopes to add capabilities like running and jumping. </h1>

								<h1 style="color:#ffffff;">The new robot is the Braava jet, a small, 
								shiny white robotic mop designed to clean hard floors, especially in bathrooms
								and kitchens. To use the Braava jet, you just need to add water to a reservoir 
								on top of the robot, attach a cleaning pad, and press the “CLEAN” button. The robot
								cleans by spraying water in front of itself and mopping the wet spot with the pad.  </h1>
